# About

## Context


The Tiramisu Project is originally a 4th year student project of the [ESIEA](https://en.esiea.fr/). At the end of his year, one of the student decided to complete the project as a part of his internship in the [ARNUM](http://www.arnum.fr/) laboratory.

## Why 'Tiramisu' ?

Well. Who doesn't like cakes? There's absolutely no reason. 

But if you really insist, Tiramisu stands for **T**ext **I**nputs **R**ead **A**s **M**atrices for the **I**nterpretation of their **S**imilarity in **U**TF-8.

Let's stick to the cake thing, okay ?
